## What is UnoCSS?

UnoCSS is an atomic CSS engine which is designed to be flexible and extensible. This makes the core is extremely lightweight (~6kb) because all the CSS utilities are provided via presets.

## Comparing UnoCSS with TailwindCSS

### TailwindCSS

TailwindCSS JIT engine works like a massive pre-made dictionary:

- Startup: When you start your dev server, it loads its entire _core_ into memory. This core is a massive dictionary of every possible utility class it supports and its corresponding CSS.
- Scanning: It watches your content files which you had already specified in `tailwind.config.js` for class strings.
- Lookup: When you add `mt-4` to your element class, the engine sees the string `mt-4`.
- Find & Generate: It looks up `mt-4` in its massive dictionary. It finds the entry: `mt-4 = margin-top: 1rem;` then generates CSS and injects it.

The slowness comes from loading and searching in that massive dictionary.

### UnoCSS

UnoCSS engine doesn't have a dictionary in it core, it generates CSS on-demand:

- Startup: When you start your dev server, UnoCSS loads only the small rules from your chosen presets. For example, `preset-wind4` gives it a rule: "If you see a string that looks like `mt-{number}`, the rule is `margin-top: {number / 4}rem;`".
- Scanning: It watches your files for class strings.
- Match & Generate: When you add `mt-4` to your element class, unlike TailwindCSS, UnoCSS does not do the searching
- Apply Rule: It tests the string `mt-4` against its list of rules. It quickly finds a match with the `mt-{number}` rule and generates the CSS by applying the rule's logic: `margin: 4 / 4 = 1rem;`.

By doing this way, UnoCSS saves a lot of time searching.

## More than an atomic CSS engine

Performing TailwindCSS's job is just one of the many jobs that UnoCSS can do:

- [@unocss/preset-icons](https://unocss.dev/presets/icons): allows you to use any icons in UnoCSS. No more setting up CDN or install icons packages.
- [@unocss/preset-web-fonts](https://unocss.dev/presets/web-fonts): allows you to use web fonts from Google Font, coolLabs Fonts, etc. without setting up them manually.
- [@unocss/preset-attributify](https://unocss.dev/presets/attributify): helps you writing classnames ergonomically.
