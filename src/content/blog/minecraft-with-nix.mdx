## What is Nix/NixOS?

Nix is a package manager that uses a scripting language called Nix to manage packages and configurations. It is a purely functional package manager that allows for reproducible builds and easy version management. NixOS is a Linux distribution that uses Nix as its package manager.

## About direnv

[direnv](https://direnv.net/) is an extension for your shell that manages environment variables based on the current directory. For example, when you enter a folder, it will load all environment variables that are defined in a `.envrc` file into a bash sub-shell and all exported variables are then captured by direnv and then made available to the current shell.

I suggest using [nix-direnv](https://github.com/nix-community/nix-direnv). For more information, you can read [here](https://github.com/nix-community/nix-direnv).

## Minecraft mod/modpack development

### For mod developers

One of the most common issues when running a Minecraft client in your mod is the GLFW library not found error. This happens because NixOS does not have a `/lib` directory, so Minecraft cannot locate the GLFW library.

The solution is to create a Nix shell and explicitly tell Minecraft where to find the GLFW library. Here's a sample shell script (this shell script had tested on Minecraft 1.21.1):

```nix
{
  inputs.nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable";

  outputs = inputs: let
    # openal doesn't support Darwin, I may add it back if I know an alternative package
    supportedSystems = ["x86_64-linux" "aarch64-linux"];
    forEachSupportedSystem = f:
      inputs.nixpkgs.lib.genAttrs supportedSystems (system:
        f rec {
          pkgs = import inputs.nixpkgs {inherit system;};

          libs = with pkgs; [
            glfw3-minecraft
            openal

            ## openal
            alsa-lib
            libjack2
            libpulseaudio
            pipewire

            ## glfw
            libGL
            xorg.libX11
            xorg.libXcursor
            xorg.libXext
            xorg.libXrandr
            xorg.libXxf86vm

            udev # oshi

            vulkan-loader # VulkanMod's lwjgl
            flite # text2speech
          ];
        });
  in {
    devShells = forEachSupportedSystem ({
      pkgs,
      libs,
    }: {
      default = pkgs.mkShell {
        packages = with pkgs; [mesa-demos pciutils xorg.xrandr];
        buildInputs = libs;
        LD_LIBRARY_PATH = pkgs.lib.makeLibraryPath libs;
      };
    });
  };
}
```

As you can see, Minecraft does not only require GLFW, but also other libraries such as OpenAL, JACK, PipeWire, libGL, and flite. <br/>
You can define a JDK version inside `packages`. For example:

```nix
packages = with pkgs; ["other packages" zulu21]
```

### For modpack developers

The most popular CLI tool for creating Minecraft modpacks is [Packwiz](https://packwiz.infra.link/). You have 2 ways to install Packwiz, the first way is install it like other packages (using home-manager is suggested), and the second way is using Nix shell. Example script for the second option:

```nix
{
  inputs.nixpkgs.url = "github:nixos/nixpkgs";

  outputs = inputs: let
    supportedSystems = ["x86_64-linux" "aarch64-linux" "x86_64-darwin" "aarch64-darwin"];
    forEachSupportedSystem = f:
      inputs.nixpkgs.lib.genAttrs supportedSystems (system:
        f {
          pkgs = import inputs.nixpkgs {inherit system;};
        });
  in {
    devShells = forEachSupportedSystem ({pkgs}: {
      default = pkgs.mkShell {
        packages = with pkgs; [packwiz];
      };
    });
  };
}
```
